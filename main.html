            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>FuturePath's mission is to make career exploration fun and 
              stress-free for students. We believe that when students have
               the opportunity to discover their passions, they can truly grow.
                Our platform offers a deep dive into different careers, helping
                 students explore their options and make informed decisions. 
                 Additionally, our opportunities search system allows students 
                 to find internships, part-time jobs, and volunteer positions 
                 to gain practical experience. With our career identification 
                 test, students can identify their strengths and interests, 
                 providing direction in their career journey. At FuturePath, 
                 we're committed to empowering students and guiding them towards 
                 a fulfilling future.
